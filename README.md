This document describes how to use a web browser and JavaScript to display images, show mouse positions, and pixel values.

If you need to view images and want to know the mouse location and pixel values, there are several image viewer options available for installation. However, after researching, I found that there was no light-weighted image viewer that could show the pixel values on the Linux platform to the best of my knowledge. As a result, I decided to write my own.

I found that using a web browser and JavaScript were sufficient to accomplish my goal. As a result, I created a JavaScript-based image viewer that can be accessed at the following link: [View Postion](https://github.com/watchakorn-18k/viewpos)

The image viewer is simple to use and provides an efficient way to view images while also displaying mouse positions and pixel values.
